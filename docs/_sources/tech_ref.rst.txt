Technical Reference
===================

This page summarizes the detailed specifications of the modules, classes, and their functions in UXsim.
This is highly technical; for the basic introduction, please see the :doc:`getting started page <./getting_started>` and :doc:`mechanism page <./mechanism>` first.

   
Classes (essential)
-------------------

These classes are essential for UXsim.
``World`` is the simulation environment and accessed by users directly.
``Node``, ``Link``, and ``Vehicle`` objects should be added to a ``World`` object by ``World.addNode``, ``World.addLink``, ``World.adddemand`` methods, and access to them is provided by ``World``.
Thus, for basic usage, users do not need to access them directly.
``RouteChoice`` is for vehicles' route choice behaviors, and basically it is not required to be directly accessed by users.
``Analyzer`` is for analysis of simulation results and it is basically accessible as ``World.analyzer``.

   :nosignatures:

   uxsim.World
   uxsim.Node
   uxsim.Link
   uxsim.Vehicle
   uxsim.RouteChoice
   uxsim.analyzer.Analyzer

Classes (support)
-----------------

These classes are not necessary for the basic usage of UXsim, but useful for specific or advanced analyses.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary
   :nosignatures:

   uxsim.Route
   uxsim.TaxiHandler.TripRequest
   uxsim.TaxiHandler.TaxiHandler
   uxsim.TaxiHandler.TaxiHandler_nearest
   uxsim.OSMImporter.OSMImporter
   uxsim.ResultGUIViewer.ResultGUIViewer


Modules
-------

These are the module and sub-module of UXsim.
For basic usage, only ``uxsim`` is required to imported.
``analyzer``, ``utils``, and ``scenario_reader_writer`` are automatically imported along with ``uxsim``, and access to them is provided by classes in ``uxsim``.
``analyzer`` is for analysis of simulation results and it is basically accessible via ``World.analyzer``.
For ``utils`` and ``scenario_reader_writer``, users will not use them directly.
The other sub-modules may be useful for specific or advanced analyses.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: _autosummary
   :nosignatures:

   uxsim.uxsim
   uxsim.utils
   uxsim.analyzer
   uxsim.scenario_reader_writer
   uxsim.ResultGUIViewer.ResultGUIViewer
   uxsim.TaxiHandler.TaxiHandler
   uxsim.Utilities.Utilities
